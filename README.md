# A CODE ISSUE SOLUTION SOCIAL DEVELOPER INTERACTION PLATFORM

***

### Problem Statement

In every day life of a developer, he or she encounters problems that seek solutions. Some problems are not defined in the documentations of the libraries they use and they are therefore forced to look for solutions at the community platforms available. In as much as they may find solutions. some are difficult to understand and they thus need the elaboration of the solution provider. Inability to reach out to the solution providers leave them in a desperate state.

### Objectives

##### General Objective

Develop a social platform for interaction of developers concerning code issues they face and solutions to them provided by each other.

##### Specific Objectives

- Have a community section where questions are asked and answers are provided by the members.
- Allow comments to solutions provided.
- Provide a direct message feature for direct communication between two developers.
- Provide auxiliary solution tools such as links and file resources as solutions to the code issues raised by the community members.
- Enable video streaming of various videos that deal with building various tools or solving various code development questions.

### Justification

In the current world of developers, development tools keep on changing and as a result the developers too need to learn techniques introduced. Sometimes, it is hard for some developers to understand the documentation provided by the libraries and therefore they seek help from their peers and colleagues. What is a better way to solve this than having an online social community where developers engage in issues and solutions? Direct messaging, video streaming, links to resources and communities where questions and answers to the questions are provided, are some of the great features a social platform for devlopers would have to enhance learning of the libraries progressively. Apart from solving issues different developers will face, it will connect them as well and they can therefore work as a team in building future projects.

### Scope

This research will be undertaken on developers as they are the major key subjects to the research. Even though there is no much guarantee that many developers will use it as a test kit when it is at its infant stage, any developer can join the platform. Methods of creating an account will be that which encourage only evelopers to join the platform since it is omly them to whom the platform is important. There, developer authentication providers will be used rather than the basic authentication of email and password.

### Methodology and Models

The research was aimed at solving the problem of communication between developers concerning coding problems each one of them face. I used both qualitative and quantitative data while collecting. I used a number of data collection methods. I conducted interviews to developers about how they find solutions to their coding problems. I came to the realization that most of them find it hard to understand the solutions that are provided by the platforms that are in existence. I also observed that some platforms do not provide the ability of solution seekers to communicate directly with the developers who have answered their questions. There is only a comment section. Putting into practice the ethnographic way of data collection, I immersed myself as a user and encounterd platform crashing issues. I addition, no relevant infromation was there to some of the questions I had therefore making my research to solving the problems even harder.
